🧠 Cyphr

The Full-Stack Web3 Infra Platform: Wallets, Chain, Dev Tools, and Immersive 3D

Website: [Your URL]
Founder: [Your Name] – ex-[X], YC-backed
Stage: Raising $1.5M Pre-Seed SAFE

🚀 What We’re Building

Cyphr is the “Stripe for Web3 onboarding + infra” — a vertically integrated stack that combines:

🔐 Access Layer: Smart wallet SDKs + Web3Auth integration

⚙️ Execution Layer: Our own EVM-compatible L1 (Cipher Chain)

🧱 Infra Layer: Custom RPC (CyphNode), relayers, SDKs

Plus: Cyengine — our open 3D engine for immersive Web3-native virtual experiences.

🎯 Why Now

Web3 UX still sucks: onboarding + infra is fragmented

ERC-4337 + smart wallets unlock mainstream-ready flows

We offer the full stack: no stitching required

🧲 Traction

MVP live: dev SDK, wallet drop-in, L1 chain forked

3D engine used to build immersive Metaverse-like experiences

Community forming: devs already building on top of Cyengine

💸 The Raise

$1.5M Pre-Seed

SAFE ($10M cap) + optional token warrant (~1–2%)

Funds used for: protocol dev, devrel, early infra scaling

🤝 Who We’re Looking For

Angels with Web3, infra, or immersive tech background

Strategic help with GTM, distribution, or protocol scaling

Long-term partners who understand the potential of unified infra

🪙 Token-Only Allocation Explainer (Investor-Friendly)

Use this if someone can’t hold equity or prefers to invest only in tokens:

🪙 Cypher Token Warrant Summary

Note: This is not a security or equity. This is a future right to receive tokens from the protocol treasury.

Offering Type: Token warrant (no equity or SAFE required)
Instrument: Simple Token Warrant Agreement (template available)
Participation Size: $10K–$250K (flexible)

⚙️ How It Works:

Investor signs a token warrant agreement

In return for funding now, they get rights to receive Cypher Tokens when the token generation event (TGE) occurs

Token unlocks + vesting structured to align with team and community

📊 Sample Terms:
Term	Example Value
Total token supply	1,000,000,000
Warrant allocation	1.5% of total (vesting)
Vesting	12-month cliff, 36-month vest
Lockup	Optional 6-month post-TGE
💡 Why Token-Only?

No need to manage equity or SAFE documents

Investor can participate early in protocol upside

Easier for DAOs, non-U.S. backers, or fund structures

📎 Ask for: Token Warrant Template + Supply Breakdown Sheet

📄 SAFE + Token Warrant Template (Summary Format)

This is a high-level summary you can include in your investor doc or FAQ. For actual legal documents, use YC's SAFE template
 and pair it with a token side letter.

📑 SAFE + Token Warrant Hybrid (Common for Web3)

You raise using a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) plus a token warrant giving rights to protocol tokens at TGE.

🔐 SAFE Terms:
Field	Example
Instrument	Y Combinator Post-Money SAFE
Cap	$10,000,000
Discount	None
Pro-rata	Yes (future rounds)
🪙 Token Warrant Side Letter:
Term	Detail
Token	Cypher Token (ERC-20)
Allocation	1–2% of total token supply
Vesting	1-year cliff, 36-month total
Lockup (optional)	3–6 months post-TGE
Transferability	Non-transferable pre-TGE
📎 Ask a Lawyer to Finalize:

Use standard YC SAFE templates

Add a Token Warrant Side Letter (or use OpenLaw / LexDAO)

Keep it clean: simple percentages + vesting schedules
