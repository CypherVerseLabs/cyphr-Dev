✅ Token Warrant Explainer (For Investors)

What is a Token Warrant?

A token warrant gives an investor the right to receive tokens in the future (once the project launches its token), typically proportional to their equity investment.

It's commonly used in Web3 hybrid fundraising:
🧾 Equity SAFE + 📈 Token warrant = ownership in both company and network.

🔐 How It Works
Item	Example
Structure	SAFE (equity) + Token Warrant
Token Warrant Amount	1–2% of token supply reserved for pre-seed investors
Vesting	1-year cliff, 3–4 year total (industry standard)
Lockup	Optional (usually 6–12 months post-token launch)
Trigger	Tokens are issued upon TGE (Token Generation Event)
Valuation Link	Often matched 1:1 with equity (e.g., $1M = 1% tokens)
🧠 Why Use It?

Lets you raise equity today, with future token upside

Keeps cap table clean (tokens don’t dilute equity)

Aligns investors with long-term network success

Gives regulatory flexibility (tokens not issued until network is live)

🔎 Legal Structure

You can use:

YC SAFE + Token Side Letter (standard format)

Or a combined SAFE with token rights clause

Use tools like Delphi's Token Side Letter
 (template) or Gunderson legal.

We recommend:

“SAFE (Valuation Cap: $10M) + Token Warrant (1–2% of token supply), subject to 12-month cliff, 36-month vesting.”
