🧠 CYPRHR / CYPHERVERSE COMBINED PITCH

One SDK. One Chain. One Engine.
The Stripe + Unity of Web3 onboarding, infrastructure, and immersive experiences.

🪐 THE PROBLEM

Web3 is fragmented.
For developers and teams trying to build, onboard, and grow users, the journey looks like this:

Dozens of providers (wallet, auth, infra, UI, chain)

Poor UX (especially for non-crypto-native users)

Costly infrastructure (RPCs, gas, chain ops)

No true immersive experience layer

Meanwhile, users are expected to:

Install extensions

Memorize seed phrases

Understand gas fees

Navigate clunky UIs

🚫 Most never make it past the first screen.

✅ OUR SOLUTION: CYPHR

We’re building a vertically integrated Web3 infrastructure platform that handles:

Layer	What We Offer
Access	🔐 Social/email logins, smart wallet onboarding
Execution	⚙️ Custom Layer 1 (Cipher Chain) + EVM support
Infrastructure	📡 RPC (CyphNode), relayers, dev dashboards
Immersive Layer	🌐 Cyengine — 3D web experience engine
Community Layer	🪩 Cypherverse — shared virtual worlds & builders

Think: Thirdweb + Alchemy + Web3Auth + Unity — under one SDK.

👨‍💻 FOR DEVELOPERS / CUSTOMERS

Cyphr helps you build Web3 apps faster, cheaper, and more immersive.

With one SDK and dashboard, you get:

🧠 Drop-in smart wallets (ERC-4337)

🔐 Social/email login (via Web3Auth or MPC)

🧰 Dev tools: RPCs, APIs, relayers, billing

🌍 3D engine (Cyengine) for interactive experiences

🔗 Custom chain for low-cost txns (Cipher Chain)

📊 Dashboards for analytics, user auth, wallet tracking

Use Cases:

Web3 games & metaverses

Brand worlds / immersive campaigns

Token-gated social apps

Web3 onboarding portals

💰 BUSINESS MODEL
Revenue Stream	Description
RPC API Tiers	Usage-based pricing (free → enterprise)
Wallet SaaS	White-label smart wallet + auth infra
Gasless TX Markup	Relayer fees on subsidized txs
Token Utility	Devs stake $CYPHR for discounts/features
Enterprise Plans	Full white-glove infra setup
🪙 TOKENS: $COIN vs $TOKEN
Token	Purpose
Cypher Coin (native gas)	Secures Cipher Chain, pays for txns
